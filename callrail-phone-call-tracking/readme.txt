Dynamically swap CallRail tracking phone numbers based on the visitor's referring source.

== Description ==

CallRail is here to bring complete visibility to the marketers who rely on quality inbound leads to measure success. Our customers live in a results-driven world, and giving them a clear view into their digital marketing efforts is a first priority for CallRail. We see the opportunities in surfacing and connecting data from calls, forms, chat and beyond â€” helping our customers get to better outcomes.

Our WordPress plugin allows you to learn detailed information about the source and web session of every caller from your website using a process called [Dynamic Number Insertion](https://www.callrail.com/leads/dynamic-number-insertion-2/). It also powers our form tracking tool, which gives you the power to attribute form submissions back to their source and learn about what the user did on your site before submitting the form.
